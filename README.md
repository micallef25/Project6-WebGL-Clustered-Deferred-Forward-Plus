# Overview

In this repo we show forward, forward+ and deferred rendering. The forward+ and deferred shaders include a light culling or binning phase where we first bin lights into AABB's or are often referred to as "clusters" or "tiles". We can then ignore parts of the scene that do not have any. 

Advantages of Deferred vs Forward+

The advantage with the deferred shading technique compared to forward rendering is that the expensive lighting calculations are only computed once per light per covered pixel.

Disadvantages of Deferred vs Forward+

One of the disadvantage of using deferred shading is that only opaque objects can be rasterized into the G-buffers. The reason for this is that multiple transparent objects may cover the same screen pixels but it is only possible to store a single value per pixel in the G-buffers. In the lighting pass the depth value, surface normal, diffuse and specular colors are sampled for the current screen pixel that is being lit. Since only a single value from each G-buffer is sampled, transparent objects cannot be supported in the lighting pass.

Another disadvantage of deferred shading is that only a single lighting model can be simulated in the lighting pass. This is due to the fact that it is only possible to bind a single pixel shader when rendering the light geometry. 

Forward plus is also easier to integrate into existing pipelines that are forward based. This is because forward+ is an extension of forward.

Below is an analysis of the three methods with varying amount of lights. As you will see the Forward render drops off signifcantly while the forward plus slowly dips. Please note I used FPS and is capped at 60 due to not being able to figure out how to uncap the limit.

Below is another graph depicting how varying the amount of lights allowed in a cluster effects the performance. As this increases we see both our deferred and forward+ reduce which is sensical. This experiment was done fixed at 3000 lights and varying the cluster lights.

## Forward

In its basic form, forward shading is a method of rendering scenes by linearly marching forward along the GPU pipeline. For each mesh and light combination we issue a single draw call additively blending the results until the image has been fully assembled. The pseduo code below helps depict the algorithm at a high level.

```C
//Shaders:
Shader simpleShader

//Buffers:
Buffer display

for mesh in scene
    for light in scene
        display += simpleShader(mesh, light)
```

## ForwardPlus

The forward+ technique invovles culling lights or a "cluster/tiling" approach and then shading. By performing the culling stage we can intelligently light our scene.

```C
//Buffers:
Buffer display
Buffer tileArray

//Shaders:
Shader manyLightShader

//Light culling
for tile in tileArray
   for light in scene
      if lightInTile(tile, light)
          tile += light
      
for tile in scene
        display += simpleShader(tile, light)

```


## Deferred

The idea behind deferred shading is that we perform all visibility and material fetching in one shader program, store the result in a buffer, and then we defer lighting and shading to another shader that takes as an input that buffer. Our "buffer" we store into is commonly known as a "Gbuffer". The contents and size of a Gbuffer will typically range. As some designers implement Gbuffers based on the task at hand or how clever the designer is at packing data. The basic pseudo code for Deferred shading is below. In our deferred method we also use the tiling approach.

```C
//Buffers:
Buffer display
Buffer GBuffer 
Buffer tileArray

//Shaders:
Shader manyLightShader
Shader writeShadingAttributes
CompShader lightInTile

//Visibility & materials
for mesh in scene
    if mesh.depth < GBuffer.depth
       GBuffer = writeShadingAttributes(mesh)

//Light culling
for tile in tileArray
   for light in scene
      if lightInTile(tile, light)
          tile += light
      
//Shading
display = manyLightShader(GBuffer, tileArray)
```


# Effects

Our provided shader comes with the typical lambert style shading. Upon this I added the blinn phong shader to make our dungeon look like a sick trap house.

There was no performance impact between the two. The blinnphong model vs the lambert model in my code was only a few extra lines of computational code which GPU's are quite good at.

there are two constant variables that can be manipulated for shininess and specular color. I have them set to purple in the image. We can tune them on the fly for your favorite color!

The blinn phong image is where I imagine DaRude first played his famous sandstorm song.

# Optimizations

## GBuffer


Reducing the number of g-buffer channels helps make deferred shading faster which can be done by compactly storing data in them. 

Colors often dont need the alpha component, normals can be reconstructed simply from 2 of their components, data can be stored as fixed point instead of floats. These are some examples of how one could intellignetly pack their data. Packing data increases speed because if we pack well we can have less memory reads which is typically the bottleneck in most applications.

This project implemented the following layout for 2 g-buffer channels used:


| R-Channel       | G-Channel     | B-Channel      | A-Channel       |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-------------:| :-------------: | 
| position_x      | position_y    | position_z     | normal_x        |
| color_x         | color_y       |   color_z      | normal_y        |

Why this packing?

We can reconstruct the z-value of the normal from its x and y values. The magnitude of a vector is defined as the ```square root of x^2 + y^2 + z^2```. This formula gives us the magnitude of z. The sign of z is positive in camera space. Using this information I was somehow able to recronstruct our scene appropritately without too much pain.

Packing our buffers using 2 channels as opposed to 4 channels had more of an impact than I anticipated. While there are less main memory reads It is only 2 but I guess this compounds pretty quickly. Below is a graph with my findings. Each run is with 3000 lights and I vary the lights per cluster.

# GUI 

attempts were made at adding num lights and max lights per cluster in the GUI because it was annoying changing them in the code. But things kept breaking and I decided I should just finish the project.

# Debilitating Bugs AKA Bloopers In CIS565 World

below is what happens when your normals are off by a bit ):.
In this scene I have 250 lights but it still quite dark.

# Bugs

When the number of lights increases > 300. My AABB boxes seem to be appearing every where. Could never unfortunately fix in time. Still renders fast doe.
